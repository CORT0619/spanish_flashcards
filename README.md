## Local Development

There are a few options to get the application started. The first option is to run the command `ng serve` and then navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

The second option is run the command `npm start` which will then open a browser when on localhost port 4200.

Lastly, if you receive an error message that port 4200 is currently in use you can run the following command and supply a different port.

`npm run start -- --port=portNumber`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests and Code Coverage

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). This command will also run code coverage and display the coverage summary.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
